// The MHGU material: MeshStandardMaterial plus the onBeforeCompile pigment / matcap shader,
// driven by what the game's own material file (.mrl) says about each material, resolved
// through the shader package into docs/materials.json (Phase 3, 2026-09-03). The shader
// text, the uniform block and the pigment math are what the single script carried, kept
// verbatim; index.html writes `tint` and calls applyTint on armorMats when a pigment changes.
//
// What the ROM decides here, per material (spec.rom, from materials-db.js specFor):
//   blend state  BSSolid opaque; BSBlendAlpha transparent, no depth write, drawn after the
//                opaque parts; BSAddAlpha additive and unlit (the glow parts); BSRevSubAlpha
//                the same but reverse-subtracted, so it DARKENS instead (monsters only:
//                Khezu's blood, Old Fatalis' face_sub, Grimclaw Tigrex's angry_arm)
//   cull         RSMesh back -> front faces only; RSMeshCN -> both; RSMeshCF -> back faces
//   depth bias   RSMeshBiasN (-32 N) -> a constant polygon offset of that many depth units
//                toward the camera, no slope term (decal layers such as the Charge Blade 064
//                shield face and the Lecturer's Footwear cuff band). A slope-scaled offset
//                pushed the cuff band through the boot shell at grazing angles (Raven,
//                2026-09-03: "a little bit of the black material ... peek out"); the constant
//                offset at the ROM's value shows none.
//   alpha        the alpha TEST is bit 20 of the material's feature word (with FTransparency
//                Alpha): discard texels at or below fAlphaClipThreshold, 0.0 on every material
//                seen, so only the exact-zero holes go. The Alpha feature without that bit
//                (Nerscylla's mail, 2,819 materials) only feeds alpha to a blend state -- the
//                game draws them whole. AlphaConstant -> the constant transparency
//   albedo tint  fAlbedoColor x fDiffuseColor multiplies the map (greys 0.8..0.95 on some)
//   emission     fEmissionColor, as self-illumination proportional to the map
//   sphere map   FReflect SphereMap -> the tSphereMap binding, scaled by fReflectiveColor
//                (0 switches it off on 31 materials that carry the feature) and the gloss:
//                the map's alpha when tSpecularMap is the albedo, else the separate specular
//                map's luminance (a greyscale mask, alpha 1.0). GlobalCubeMap is the stage's
//                reflection, which the viewer has no stand-in for: no term
//   Fresnel      Schlick with fFresnelSchlickRGB as F0 (1.0 on 246 of 264 globals: no change)
//   pigment      flag 0x20 marks the dyeable region (the `_sym_` materials, 99% of them);
//                flag 0x40 without 0x20 is the colour-override class (skin, fur, face)
// Approximations kept from before: the studio lights, roughness .85 (lowered only where
// fShininess exceeds 16), the screen-blended matcap at envAmount.

//   colour = albedo x FDiffuse + FSpecularMap x FFresnel, alpha = vertex alpha x FTransparencyAlpha, blended BSAddAlpha

//   FReflectSphereMap = tSphereMap(uv) x CBMaterial.fReflectiveColor, uv = normalize(View x normal).xy x 0.5 + 0.5, v flipped
//   FFresnelSchlick = fFresnelSchlick + (1 - it) x (1 - N.V)^5, and fFresnelSchlick is 1.0: no term
//   FTransparencyAlpha = transparency x CBMaterial.fTransparency; FAlbedoMap (not ColorOnly) first multiplies the

// So what shows is the SPHERE MAP TINTED BY fReflectiveColor -- the colour the oils write (0x53a254) and the Spirit clips
// animate -- faded by fTransparency. The old additive path drew the albedo map instead, which the ROM multiplies by zero,
// and hid the layers that bind no albedo (the Sword & Shield's): both wrong for these.
//   UNBOUND TEXTURES: none of these layers binds tSpecularMap, and 120 Sword & Shield layers bind no albedo either. Read
// as black, the spec map would zero the only term there is and no oil or Spirit level could ever show, which the game's
// own authoring (a sphere map, a colour, an animated fade on a layer that is otherwise nothing) rules out: they read as
// white here, the albedo's alpha as 1.
//   NOT DRAWN, deliberately: the lights' specular term (x fSpecularColor, which the Spirit clips colour; the viewer's lights
// are a studio stand-in) and the albedo term of the one layer whose fDiffuseColor is not zero (the Sword & Shield 151).
// fUVTransform2 is the second UV set, which the sphere lookup does not read.
// The arithmetic runs on the texel as the file holds it (the sRGB-encoded value) and is decoded again, as the lit path's
// sheen is: the ROM's colour constants act on its texture values.
// THE CHARGE BLADE'S PHIAL LAYER is the same layer on channel 30 (2026-10-03; Raven: "it does not show the phial color on

//     [ a  b  0  tx ]

// with identity [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0]. The animated fUVTransform tracks build exactly this matrix at
// runtime (0xb0ca90..0xb0caf0: sin/cos into [sx*cos, -sy*sin, 0, tx] / [sx*sin, sy*cos, 0, ty]).

// Only the PRIMARY matrix maps onto a three.js texture's offset/repeat, and over this app's own
// data that is 8 material instances -- the bulk of the non-identity rows sit in fUVTransform2, the
// SECOND UV set, which belongs to the TypeExtend two-map albedo path and has no home here yet.
// Rotation is effectively unused (of 3,058 animated UV keys in the library exactly one carries a
// non-zero angle), so `center` stays at three.js's default rather than moving to the ROM's pivot.

// THE TEXTURE IS SHARED, so a non-identity transform gets its own handle: getTexture hands every
// material binding a file ONE cached object, and writing offset/repeat onto it would move every
// other material drawing that texture. Texture.clone() shares `source`, which is what three.js

// update the armor viewer with the lessons learned". The .mrl carries an animation block per
// material -- decoded by build-matanim.py -- and 1,486 of this app's materials have one (370
// armour pieces, 1,116 weapons, 5,174 tracks, 1,177 clips auto-play). They were all drawn frozen at
// frame 0: materials.json shipped the blocks for monsters only until the builder's armour pass was
// run here (2026-09-27), and nothing played them.
//
// THE CLIP-SELECTION POLICY STAYS WITH THE CALLER. The ROM's own default is the auto-play bit
// (AUTO_CLIP), which is what this app wants; the monster app layers a rage state machine over it.
//
// THE FRAME RATE is an assumption, not a reading, and it is the Monster Viewer's: the evaluator's
// clock is `slotTime += material[+0x20] * dt` and the sum is compared against the clip's frame
// count, so the two share a unit -- but material[+0x20] itself is written by code nobody has found,
// so the wall-clock rate is open. 60 is the value that library was reviewed at; the argument for 30
// (a rate multiplier's neutral value is 1.0, so dt would be in ticks, and MHGU ticks at ~30) is
// real and recorded there, and changing it globally there regressed a monster already signed off.
// Same number here, so the two apps agree, and it belongs in a control rather than a constant swap.

// from a known state: the ROM rebuilds its constant buffer from the material's own values each
// frame, while these writes land on a three.js material and would otherwise accumulate.
//
// THE TEXTURE HANDLE IS THIS APP'S ONE DEPARTURE. fUVTransform drives the texture object, and the
// monster app may write it because a monster owns its maps -- here the pool is content-addressed
// and shared, and all 168 materials that animate the primary UV share their map with another
// material of the same piece (a helm's scrolling glow beside its still body texture). So a material

  // shader's `totalEmissiveRadiance *= gBase` lives inside `#ifdef USE_EMISSIVEMAP`. A material whose
  // constant is zero gets no such map, so when a CLIP writes fEmissionColor onto it the emission is a
  // flat glow over the whole surface instead of the map's own bright texels.
  //   That is the Esurient sets (Raven, 2026-09-27: "Esurient armor glows oddly, the armor itself is
  // glowing not the pigment"): their `_env_` materials ship emission 0, so they had no emissive map,
  // and their clips write a small emission that lit the entire piece rather than the dye region. Give
  // such a material the same map the static path would have given it, once, before the first write.
  //   ONLY A MATERIAL WITH AN EMISSIVE TERM CAN TAKE ONE. An additive or constant material is a
  // MeshBasicMaterial: no `.emissive`, and no `emissiveMap` uniform either, so three.js's uniform refresh
  // throws on the map (`uniforms.emissiveMap` is undefined) and the throw takes the whole frame with it.
  // That was Raikou Works (Raven, 2026-09-29: "Raikou Works has a bug"): its `axe147_add_` layer is

// A MATERIAL LAID OVER A WEAPON PART'S OWN, as the part unit does it (0x305f3c, every frame the part holds an override at
// +0x13b0), into each of the part's materials whose colour channel is not masked out:
//   * THE FRAME IT CHANGES (0x30679c): CBMaterial.fDiffuseColor and fReflectiveColor, $Globals.fSpecularColor (+0xb0) and
//     fEmissionColor (+0xc0), the CBAmbient colour where both carry one, the tFresnelMap / tShininessMap bindings where
//     the override binds them -- the override material's values AT THAT MOMENT;
//   * EVERY FRAME AFTER (0x3063cc): fReflectiveColor and fEmissionColor only, again as they stand now.
// "As they stand" because the override is a live material with its own clip: the player keeps a clone of each part-state
// material (0x2895d4: res->vt+0x44(0), ->vt+0x1c) and steps them all every frame by its own frame delta (vtable +0x60 =
// 0x27bcb8 -> each material's vt+0x20 = 0xb0cffc, the clip evaluator 0xb0ba84), from the moment it is loaded -- not from
// the moment it is laid on. So fSpecularColor keeps whatever value the clip had on the frame the override took hold.
// `o` is { diffuse, reflective, specular, emission } (each [r, g, b] or absent) and, when the override material is
// animated, `anim`: its auto-play clip (build-matanim.py's shape), evaluated on the clock stepMaterialAnim is handed; or
// null to give the material back its own. The Lance's Healing Shield puts player/mod/common/pl_lance_up.mrl on the
// shield this way (render/weapon-state.js LANCE_UP). On the lit path: the colour is fAlbedoColor x fDiffuseColor,
// fReflectiveColor the sphere map's weight AND hue (uReflTint), fSpecularColor uSpecRGB, fEmissionColor the emissive
// over the albedo map (the ROM's PS_MaterialStd adds FEmissionConstant into mc.diffuse, which FFinalCombiner multiplies
// by the albedo); on the reflection overlay only fReflectiveColor has a term. A material's own clips run under it: the
// part writes the override after them, every frame (stepMaterialAnim).
