// so the manifests were fresh while the .glb and .webp they name came from the browser's disk
// cache -- the worst possible split, because everything the app REPORTS is current while the
// geometry on screen is old. It cost Raven two rounds there of looking at a model that had
// already been repaired and pushed ("Hard Refreshed and still see the weld"). GitHub Pages
// serves these with a freshness lifetime and the browser does not revalidate inside it, so an
// ETag does not save us; this app is served the same way.
//   PER LOAD, not per request: the stamp is fixed for the life of the page, so switching
// hunters, weapons or poses still hits the browser cache and costs nothing, and only a reload
// refetches -- which is the whole contract of "hard refresh and look again".
